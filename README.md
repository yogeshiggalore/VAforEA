About XL4015 power supply module.
The XL4015 power supply module has onboard constant voltage (CV) and constant current (CC) control feature which is useful for general-purpose power supply and battery charger applications.

apart from the input and output screw terminal connectors, there are two multiturn trimpots to adjust the output voltage and output current. Further, there are three LED indicators – the first one near the input connector is the constant-current (cc) indicator, while next two LEDs are intended mainly for battery charging applications (battery charging and battery full indicators). However, when used as a general-purpose power supply, the battery charging indicator LED will work as a ‘load-on’ annunciator.

Slowly turning the voltage adjustment (V-ADJ) trimpot clockwise will raise the output voltage gradually, and a counterclockwise rotation will lower it. Likewise, clockwise turning of the current adjustment (I-ADJ) trimpot increases the current limit while counterclockwise action decreases the current limit. It’s advised to adjust the voltage level at first, and then the current level (this fine-tuning procedure will be discussed in detail later).
